   abstract = {Navigation systems engineering is a red-hot area. More and more technical professionals are entering the field and looking for practical, up-to-date engineering know-how. This single-source reference answers the call, providing both an introduction to overall systems operation and an in-depth treatment of architecture, design, and component integration. This book explains how satellite, on-board, and other navigation technologies operate, and it gives practitioners insight into performance issues such as processing chains and error sources. Providing solutions to systems designers and engineers, the book describes and compares different integration architectures, and explains how to diagnose errors. Moreover, this hands-on book includes appendices filled with terminology and equations for quick referencing.},

   edition = {Third Edition},
   abstract = {This thoroughly updated third edition of an Artech House bestseller brings together a team of leading experts providing a current and comprehensive treatment of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that readers won't find in other resources. Packed with brand new material, this third edition includes new chapters on the system engineering details of GPS, European Galileo system, Chinese Beidou systems, GLONASS, and regional systems, such as Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) and Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC). Readers also find new coverage of GNSS receivers, disruptions, errors, stand-alone GNSS performance, differential and precise point positioning. This single-source reference provides both a quick overview of GNSS essentials and an in-depth treatment of advanced topics and explores all the latest advances in technology, applications, and systems. Readers are guided in the development of new applications and on how to evaluate their performance. It explains all the differential GNSS services available to help decide which is best for a particular application. The book discusses the integration of GNSS with other sensors and network assistance. Readers learn how to build GNSS receivers and integrate them into navigational and communications equipment. Moreover, this unique volume helps determine how technology is affecting the marketplace and where best to invest in a company's resources.},
