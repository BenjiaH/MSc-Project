   abstract = {In the design of a global navigation satellite system receiver, the tracking performance depends on the code tracking loop and the associated discriminator. An adaptive code discriminator under a multi-correlator architecture has been designed based on a multi-objective principle to achieve a balance among various, sometimes conflicting, design objectives. With the proposed optimization approach and adaptive logic, concerns of large pull-in region and small steady-state error can be addressed. The proposed scheme is implemented in a digital signal processor/field programmable gate array board and an experiment is conducted to process GIOVE-A signals. The test results reveal the advantages of the proposed code tracking architecture and discriminator design.},

   abstract = {As part of the GPS modernization, the GPS L1 C/A signal will be augmented by the L1C signal. With this improvement, for the first time, several signals from the same constellation will be available at the same frequency. In this paper, an acquisition method is implemented to combine the GPS L1 C/A and L1C signals before correlation. The combined acquisition succeeds to acquire the signal at low C/N<sub>0</sub>, whereas the acquisition of the L1C data channel alone fails. Concerning the tracking, a method to combine the GPS L1 C/A and L1C signals before the discriminator is developed. This method shows better performance than the traditional tracking using only one signal. Finally, a Kalman filter to combine the signals in the tracking is developed. It shows better performance than the traditional tracking in all conditions. Since the L1C signal will not be broadcast before 2013, these methods are tested using a software signal simulator.},

Long-term evolution of GNSS orbits and orbit keeping maneuvers are discussed. The concepts of broadcast orbit models such as almanac models, analytical ephemeris models and numerical ephemeris models used by current GNSS systems are presented along with cook book algorithms and aÂ summary of their performance. Complementary to the discussion of GNSS satellite orbits, the chapter introduces the basic concepts of GNSS satellite attitude, which are, for example, required to describe the antenna location relative to the center-of-mass.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the design and analysis of dual-mode numerically controlled oscillators (NCO) based controlled oscillator frequency Modulation is implemented. Initially, input is given to the analog to digital (ADC) converter. This will change the input from analog to digital converter. After that, the pulse skipping mode (PSM) logic and proportional integral (PI) are applied to the converted data. After applying PSM logic, data is directly transferred to the connection block. The proportional and integral block will transfer the data will be decoded using the decoder. After decoding the values, it is saved using a modulo accumulator. After that, it is converted from one hot residue (OHR) to binary converter. The converted data is saved in the register. Now both data will pass through the gate driver circuit and output will be obtained finally. From simulation results, it can observe that the usage of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and total nodes are very less in dual-mode NCO-based controlled oscillator frequency modulation.},
