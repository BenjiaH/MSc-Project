   abstract = {This thoroughly updated third edition of an Artech House bestseller brings together a team of leading experts providing a current and comprehensive treatment of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that readers won't find in other resources. Packed with brand new material, this third edition includes new chapters on the system engineering details of GPS, European Galileo system, Chinese Beidou systems, GLONASS, and regional systems, such as Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) and Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC). Readers also find new coverage of GNSS receivers, disruptions, errors, stand-alone GNSS performance, differential and precise point positioning. This single-source reference provides both a quick overview of GNSS essentials and an in-depth treatment of advanced topics and explores all the latest advances in technology, applications, and systems. Readers are guided in the development of new applications and on how to evaluate their performance. It explains all the differential GNSS services available to help decide which is best for a particular application. The book discusses the integration of GNSS with other sensors and network assistance. Readers learn how to build GNSS receivers and integrate them into navigational and communications equipment. Moreover, this unique volume helps determine how technology is affecting the marketplace and where best to invest in a company's resources.},

   pages = {255-266},
   abstract = {In the design of a global navigation satellite system receiver, the tracking performance depends on the code tracking loop and the associated discriminator. An adaptive code discriminator under a multi-correlator architecture has been designed based on a multi-objective principle to achieve a balance among various, sometimes conflicting, design objectives. With the proposed optimization approach and adaptive logic, concerns of large pull-in region and small steady-state error can be addressed. The proposed scheme is implemented in a digital signal processor/field programmable gate array board and an experiment is conducted to process GIOVE-A signals. The test results reveal the advantages of the proposed code tracking architecture and discriminator design.},

   title = {Combined Acquisition and Tracking Methods for GPS L1 C/A and L1C Signals},
   journal = {International Journal of Navigation and Observation},
   volume = {2010},
   pages = {190465},
   abstract = {As part of the GPS modernization, the GPS L1 C/A signal will be augmented by the L1C signal. With this improvement, for the first time, several signals from the same constellation will be available at the same frequency. In this paper, an acquisition method is implemented to combine the GPS L1 C/A and L1C signals before correlation. The combined acquisition succeeds to acquire the signal at low C/N<sub>0</sub>, whereas the acquisition of the L1C data channel alone fails. Concerning the tracking, a method to combine the GPS L1 C/A and L1C signals before the discriminator is developed. This method shows better performance than the traditional tracking using only one signal. Finally, a Kalman filter to combine the signals in the tracking is developed. It shows better performance than the traditional tracking in all conditions. Since the L1C signal will not be broadcast before 2013, these methods are tested using a software signal simulator.},
