\begin{abstract}

GPS/GNSS has an important position and role in daily life production as well as in military field. A set of good performance of GPS receiver can be half the effort. This paper uses VHDL language to design the tracking module of GPS/GNSS receiver, which is one of the core modules of the receiver. I will introduce the principle and design method of each submodule respectively, and finally complete the design of the correlator.
