\chapter{Introduction}

GNSS stands for \textit{Global Navigation Satellite System}. It is a constellation of satellites that provides geolocation and time information to users anywhere on Earth. The system works by transmitting signals from multiple satellites in space, which are then received by GNSS receivers on the ground. By analyzing the signals from several satellites, these receivers can determine the user's precise location, velocity, and time. GNSS technology has become an integral part of modern society and plays a crucial role in various applications.
