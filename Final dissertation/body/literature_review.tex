\section{Interface Control Document\texorpdfstring{\cite{RN170, RN171, RN172, RN174, RN173, RN175}}{}}
In complex engineering projects and system development, clear and effective communication between various subsystems and components is essential for successful integration and operation. The \textit{Interface Control Document} (ICD) of GNSS provides the basic information of the system, such as intermediate frequency, modulation scheme, code frequency, etc. 

After reviewing the interface control documents of some systems, we have summarised the parameters of each system in Tbl. \ref{tab:spec_gnss}.

Given that the GPS system was the first to be deployed, it possesses a relatively straightforward structure. As a result, the GPS L1 signal has been selected as the primary target signal for this project. Furthermore, it is important to note that the L5 signal has ten times the bandwidth of L1. Thus, in the event that the utilisation of the L5 signal becomes necessary, the adjustments required for its implementation would be minimal.

\section{Book from P. D. Groves\texorpdfstring{\cite{RN178}}{}}
This book offers a thorough textbook on navigation systems, which make use of GNSS, \textit{Intelligent Navigation Systems} (INS), and other sensors to deliver precise \textit{positioning, navigation, and timing} (PNT) data. Paul D. Groves and Kayton M. Ned, two renowned authorities in the subject of navigation systems, are the esteemed authors behind this work.

Professor of satellite navigation at University College London, Paul D. Groves' research focuses on navigation algorithms and technology. Kayton M. Ned, on the other hand, was an expert in navigation and control systems for aerospace applications and was a former Stanford University professor of aeronautics and astronautics. With their wealth of knowledge and experience, they are qualified to write a thorough and reliable textbook on navigation systems.

The basics of GNSS systems are described in Section 8.1, which will provide us a foundational understanding. It explains how to find the receiver's distance from the satellite.

The user equipment in Chapter 9 refers to the receiver. It describes how GNSS receivers are made. An antenna, reception hardware, range processor, and navigation processor are all components of a GNSS receiver. The tracking component of the ranging processor is the main focus of my work. This chapter makes note of the six correlators that make up a basic receiver design and the frequent use of additional correlators to quicken signal collection. There is also a comprehensive flowchart of the capture procedure available.

In general, as this book is a textbook, it provides a very authoritative and accurate introduction to GNSS-related technologies. It is reliable and thought-provoking.

\section{Book from E. D. Kaplan and C. Hegarty\texorpdfstring{\cite{RN177}}{}}
Elliott D. Kaplan has made significant contributions to the development and understanding of GNSS technology. Christopher J. Hegarty is also a prominent figure in the GNSS community. He has extensive experience with GPS and other satellite navigation systems. They have been associated with the MITRE Corporation and contributed to the advancement of GNSS technology and its applications.

The book delves into the fundamental principles underlying GNSS technology, including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, and others. It explores the concepts of satellite orbits, signal structure, receiver design, and various positioning techniques used in GNSS applications.

Chapters 3 to 7 provide a systematic introduction to the various navigation systems, including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, etc. It is of great help for the background part of the project. Chapter 8 details the design of the receiver and introduces the antenna, RF front-end, acquisition and tracking respectively, as well as the design of the loop filter. This part was extremely helpful to my understanding. It describes the working principle and the GNSS process through numerous mathematical equations.

\section{Paper from J. C. Juang, Y. H. Chen et al.\texorpdfstring{\cite{RN147}}{}}
The paper titled "\textit{Design and implementation of an adaptive code discriminator in a DSP/FPGA-based Galileo receiver}" is authored by Jyh Ching Juang, Yu Hsuan Chen, Tsai Ling Kao, and Yung Fu Tsai from National Cheng Kung University.

The coded tracking loop and its related discriminator play a significant role in the tracking performance of their work on the GNSS receiver design. The authors suggested a plan that was put into practice on a DSP/FPGA board to improve tracking performance. The GIOVE-A signal was used for testing in experiments, and the outcomes showed the benefits of their suggested code tracking architecture and discriminator design.

The paper presents a well-defined design methodology for an adaptive coding discriminator, which was subsequently implemented and thoroughly tested. This design approach is framed as an optimisation problem leading to the development of two discriminators. Notably, the adaptive \textit{noncoherent multi-correlator} (NMC) discriminator showcased improvements in transient response and tracking error.

Throughout the article, detailed mathematical principles of capture, tracking, and other processes are elaborated, along with a description of the correlator's design ideas. Numerous test results for correlators based on the new approach are provided, making this paper a valuable reference for my MSc project.

\section{Paper from O. Jakubov, P. Kovar et al.\texorpdfstring{\cite{RN155}}{}}
To develop advanced GNSS signal processing algorithms, such as multi-constellation, multi-frequency, and multi-antenna navigation, a flexible and re-programmable \textit{software-defined radio} (SDR) solution is essential. To achieve this goal, the researchers have introduced various receiver architectures. Their chosen approach involves constructing an RF front-end with an FPGA universal correlator, mounted on an ExpressCard directly connected to a PC. This setup allows GNSS researchers and engineers to write signal processing algorithms (e.g., tracking, acquisition, and localization) in a Linux application programming interface. The unique hardware configuration enables easy modification of the RF front-end via a PC program, providing the flexibility to increase the number of RF channels, correlators, or antennas by attaching more ExpressCards to the PC, thus enhancing computational capability.

Utilizing the SDR platform, they have successfully implemented a GNSS receiver, offering significant advantages, including low cost, high software customization, and the potential for straightforward upgrades in computational power. The article also discusses a generic FPGA-based GNSS receiver, allowing a comparison of the different approaches' advantages and disadvantages.

The outcome of their work is the prototype of the Witch Navigator receiver. They have conducted successful tests on Galileo E5, E1b, and E1c signals with the correlator and the RF front-end. Moreover, they have fully addressed the communication between the FPGA and the PC, developing and testing all the corresponding controllers and drivers.

The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the design principles for receivers based on FPGAs, and the SDR platform enables the validation of the FPGA platform through MATLAB simulations. This combination of approaches facilitates the development of advanced and adaptable GNSS signal processing algorithms for future navigation systems.
