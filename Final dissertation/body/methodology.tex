\section{Tracking}
A complete GPS/GNSS work process that includes: acquisition, tracking and navigation. My project is mainly focused on the tracking stage.

After the acquisition phase, where the receiver identifies and locks onto the satellite signals, the tracking phase begins. During this phase, the receiver closely monitors the received signals and tracks their variations in order to accurately determine the user's position, velocity, and timing information. This involves maintaining a stable lock on the satellite signals despite various challenges, such as signal degradation due to atmospheric conditions, obstructions, and interference.
